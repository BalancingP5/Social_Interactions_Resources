Balancing Social Interactions and Access to Resources

We study the behavior of interacting agent systems that balance social needs and access to resources. Agents can experience benefits (or costs) when close to each other and must also leverage costs of transporting the necessary resources to survive. We model these systems with an energy functional which combines a pairwise interaction kernel with an optimal transport cost. We study this functional analytically and numerically; of particular interest is understanding what conditions precipitate the formation of “cities,” or clusters of agents.
