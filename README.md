Balancing Social Interactions and Access to Resources

Whether studying the emergence of human settlements or the development of distribution hubs, the tendency of interacting agent systems to cluster depends on two factors: the benefits (and disadvantages) of local social interactions and the costs of transporting resources. We propose an energy functional which combines these two factors and study this functional analytically and numerically: of particular interest is understanding what conditions precipitate the formation of "cities," or clusters of agents.
